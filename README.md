# MolecularBridge

## Problem Statement

Drug discovery is inefficient, slow, and extremely expensive:

* Takes **15+ years** and costs **\$2.6 billion** per approved drug.
* Only **10% success rate** in clinical trials due to poor target selection.
* Relies on expensive, time-consuming wet-lab experiments (months to screen a single target).
* Existing AI approaches are limited to either molecular structure or protein sequence, missing critical interactions.
* No uncertainty quantification available to support clinical decision-making.

**Core Challenge:**
How can we accurately predict which drugs will bind to which protein targets using AI, while providing interpretable results and confidence scores useful for pharmaceutical research?

## Solution Overview

MolecularBridge is a **multi-modal AI system** that predicts drug-target interactions by combining diverse data types and methodologies:

* **Drug Representation:** Molecular structure (graphs, sequences, fingerprints).
* **Protein Representation:** Amino acid sequences, secondary structure features.
* **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Attention mechanisms to highlight key features and intelligently combine drug and protein information.
* **Uncertainty Quantification:** Confidence scores to assess prediction reliability.
* **Interpretability:** Attention visualization maps show what drives predictions.

**Outputs:**

* Quantitative binding affinity predictions (pIC50).
* Binary interaction classification (Yes/No).
* Visual explanations of important molecular and protein regions.
* Prediction confidence scores.

## Real-World Impact

* **Faster Drug Discovery:** Reduce time from 15 years to 10â€“12 years by computationally screening poor candidates early.
* **Lower Costs:** Replace expensive wet-lab experiments (\~\$10K per target) with \~\$1 per computational prediction.
* **Higher Success Rate:** Improve clinical trial success rate from 10% to 15%+.
* **Personalized Medicine:** Predict drug effectiveness based on patient-specific protein variants.
* **Drug Repurposing:** Rapid identification of new uses for existing approved drugs.
* **Global Health:** Enable drug discovery for rare diseases and support pandemic response efforts.
